# CafeX Events Management - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Complete Database Integration with Image Upload**

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive Supabase database integration for your CafeX events management system with full image upload capabilities.

## 🗄️ **Database Schema (`supabase/events_schema.sql`)**

### Tables Created:
- **`events`** - Complete event storage with dual image support
- **Auto status management** - Events automatically transition from upcoming → ongoing → completed
- **Indexes** - Optimized for date, status, featured, and active queries
- **Triggers** - Automatic timestamp updates and status management

### Storage Setup:
- **`event-images` bucket** - 5MB file size limit
- **Public access** - Images accessible without authentication
- **File type validation** - JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF only
- **Organized structure** - Files stored in `events/` folder

### Security Policies:
- **Public read access** - Active events visible to all
- **Admin write access** - CRUD operations require authentication
- **Storage policies** - Secure upload/delete for authenticated users

## 🖼️ **Image Upload System**

### Dual Image Support:
1. **External URLs** - Direct links (Unsplash, CDN, etc.)
2. **File Uploads** - Direct upload to Supabase storage

### Upload Features:
- **File validation** - Format and size checking
- **Live preview** - See how images look in event cards
- **Progress indicators** - Upload status with spinner
- **Error handling** - Clear feedback for failed uploads
- **Auto URL generation** - Uploaded files get public URLs

### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Upload workflow
const filePath = await EventsService.uploadImage(file, eventId)
// File stored as: event-images/events/filename.jpg
// Public URL: https://project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/event-images/events/filename.jpg
```

## 🔧 **Service Layer Architecture**

### EventsService (`src/services/eventsService.ts`):
- **CRUD operations** - Create, read, update, delete events
- **Image management** - Upload, delete, URL generation
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript integration
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error management
- **Date filtering** - Get events by date range

### React Hooks (`src/hooks/useEvents.ts`):
- **`usePublicEvents()`** - For home page and events page
- **`useAdminEvents()`** - For admin panel management
- **`useEventsByCategory()`** - For category-specific queries
- **`useEventsByDateRange()`** - For calendar date filtering
- **Loading states** - Proper loading indicators
- **Error handling** - Graceful error recovery

## 🎨 **UI Components Updated**

### Admin Panel (`src/admin/`):
- **EventCard** - Enhanced with image upload and new fields
- **EventsManagement** - Full CRUD with database integration
- **Status management** - Toggle upcoming/ongoing/completed
- **Featured toggle** - Mark events for home page display

### Public Pages:
- **UpcomingEvents** - Fetches featured events from database
- **EventsCalendarAndFeatured** - Dynamic events with calendar integration
- **Fallback system** - Sample data when database unavailable

## 🚀 **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Real-time Synchronization**
- Admin changes immediately visible on public pages
- No cache invalidation needed
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### 2. **Image Upload Workflow**
```
Admin Panel → Select File → Validate → Upload to Supabase → Store Path in DB → Display on Public Pages
```

### 3. **Auto Status Management**
- Events automatically update status based on date
- Database triggers handle transitions
- No manual status updates needed

### 4. **Calendar Integration**
- Events appear as dots on calendar dates
- Date range filtering functionality
- Visual event indicators

### 5. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**
- Database connection failures → Sample data
- Image upload failures → Clear error messages
- Missing images → Graceful degradation

## 📋 **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Run SQL Schema**
```sql
-- Copy content from supabase/events_schema.sql
-- Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Execute to create tables, policies, and sample data
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 3. **Test the System**
- Home page: Featured events from database
- Events page: All events with calendar integration
- Admin panel: Full CRUD with image upload

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### Adding Event with Image Upload:
1. **Access Admin Panel** → Events Management
2. **Click "Add New Event"**
3. **Fill details** (title, description, date, time, capacity, price)
4. **Select "Upload" tab**
5. **Choose image file** (under 5MB)
6. **Set category and type**
7. **Mark as featured** (to show on home page)
8. **Click "Create Event"**
9. **Image uploads to Supabase storage**
10. **Event appears immediately** in admin grid and public pages

### Managing Existing Events:
- **Hover over cards** → Edit, toggle status/featured, delete
- **Real-time updates** → Changes reflect immediately
- **Image replacement** → Upload new images anytime
- **Status transitions** → Automatic based on date

## 🔍 **Database Structure**

### Events Table:
```sql
events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  date DATE,
  time VARCHAR(50),
  image_url TEXT,           -- External URLs
  image_file_path TEXT,     -- Uploaded files
  status VARCHAR(20),       -- upcoming/ongoing/completed
  capacity INTEGER,
  registered INTEGER,
  price VARCHAR(50),
  category VARCHAR(100),
  type VARCHAR(100),        -- For display
  featured BOOLEAN,
  active BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Storage Structure:
```
event-images/
  └── events/
      ├── event1.jpg
      ├── event2.png
      └── event3.webp
```
