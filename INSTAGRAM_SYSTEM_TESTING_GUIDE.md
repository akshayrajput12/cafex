## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: "Unable to load posts" in admin panel**

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Database Connection**:
   ```bash
   # Check browser console for errors
   # Look for Supabase connection errors
   ```
   - Verify `.env` file has correct Supabase URL and key
   - Check Supabase project is active and accessible

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check if user is properly authenticated
   console.log(supabase.auth.getUser())
   ```
   - Ensure admin user is logged in
   - Check RLS policies allow authenticated access

3. **Table Missing**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify table exists
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'instagram_posts';
   ```
   - Run main schema if table doesn't exist
   - Run fixes schema if table exists but has issues

### **Issue: "Posts not displaying on home page"**

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Posts not marked as featured**:
   ```sql
   -- Check featured posts
   SELECT id, title, featured, status, active FROM instagram_posts WHERE featured = true;
   ```
   - Ensure posts are marked as "featured" AND "published" AND "active"

2. **Image URLs not loading**:
   ```sql
   -- Check image paths
   SELECT id, title, image_url, image_file_path FROM instagram_posts;
   ```
   - Verify external URLs are accessible
   - Check uploaded files exist in storage bucket

3. **JavaScript Errors**:
   ```bash
   # Check browser console for errors
   # Look for transform function errors
   ```

### **Issue: "Image upload failing"**

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Storage Bucket Issues**:
   ```sql
   -- Check bucket exists
   SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'instagram-images';
   ```
   - Run fixes schema to ensure bucket is created
   - Check bucket policies allow uploads

2. **File Size/Type Issues**:
   - Ensure file is under 5MB
   - Check file type is JPEG, PNG, WebP, or GIF
   - Verify file is not corrupted

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Ensure user is authenticated for uploads
   - Check storage policies allow authenticated uploads

### **Issue: "Posts created but not appearing in grid"**

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1. **React State Issues**:
   ```javascript
   // Check if hooks are updating properly
   // Look for console errors in useAdminInstagram hook
   ```
   - Refresh the page to see if posts appear
   - Check browser console for hook errors

2. **Database Transaction Issues**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if posts were actually created
   SELECT * FROM instagram_posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - Verify posts exist in database
   - Check if RLS policies are blocking reads

## üîç **Debug Queries**

### **Check Database State**
```sql
-- Count posts by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM instagram_posts GROUP BY status;

-- Check featured posts
SELECT id, title, featured, status, active FROM instagram_posts WHERE featured = true;

-- Check recent posts
SELECT id, title, status, created_at FROM instagram_posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check storage bucket
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'instagram-images';

-- Check policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd 
FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'instagram_posts';
```

### **Check Frontend State**
```javascript
// In browser console
// Check if posts are loading
console.log('Posts:', posts);
console.log('Featured Posts:', featuredPosts);
console.log('Loading:', loading);
console.log('Error:', error);

// Check Supabase connection
console.log('Supabase URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL);
```
